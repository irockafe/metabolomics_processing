Files that are used with /src/data/organize_raw_data.py
to move raw data files into useful folders that xcms will
use to process data from a particular experiment/run.

Example:
python /src/data/organize_raw_data.py -sf organize_data_mtbls315.tab

Mostly separating projects by positive/negative mode and sending to their own folders
