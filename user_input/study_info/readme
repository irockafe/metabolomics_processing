yaml files here are used to tell various scripts where raw data is and what type of Mass-spectrometer and chromatography was used for setting xcms parameters.

Layout of files is as follows keys in {brackets} are variable by the user.
Those that are not bracketed are not variable, they're keys that are used
by scripts to find values:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

{Study_name}:  # key is variable, i.e MTBLS72, MTBLS315, etc
               # no value
   organize: # key isn't variable
             # values are list of strings of bash commands
             # Example: - "unzip ST000388.zip"
             #          - "dtrx ST000388/*.7z"
   assays:  # key isn't variable, no value
      {assay_name}:  # key is variable - will become the name of subfolder
                     # no value
         files: # bash commands to organize files into a subfolder
                # could also include unzip commands
                # values are list of strings
                # Example: - '*POS*.mzML'
                #          - '*P*.mzML'
         chromatography:  # Options are [hplc, uplc]
                          # Used to set initial parameters for xcms
         mass_spectrometer:  # Options are [qtof, qtof_hires, orbitrap]
                             # Used to set initial parameters for xcms
         instrument: # (Optional) more specific than mass_spectrometer
         column:  # Not yet used by downstream scripts. Be generic,
                  # C8, C18, HILIC, not C8 2.1mm x 0.1mm. Goal is to
                  # be able to filter studies by the column used
         data_path:  # Where the raw data for this assay will be
                     # Generally will be data/raw/{study}/{assay}
   disease:  # list of tags that describe the disease
