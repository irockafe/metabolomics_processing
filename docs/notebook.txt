Wrote code to 
  - plot feature sparsity
  - tidy xcms data
  - breakdown categorical plots (violins, boxplots)
     into subplots that are more readable than one
     60+ entry plot
  - a class to organize xcms data that can:
    - map sample names to class labels from Metabolights projects with
      a_*.txt and s_*.txt files.
    - encode the sample values for sklearn stuff
    - remove the prefixes xcms seems to give all filenames things

Wrote code to
  - plot mean feature intensity between classes
  - plot feature sparsity between classes
  - do 2-sample stat tests (mann-whitney) on a dataframe
  - worked-around a weird bug in pd.df.fillna() - 
       nans weren't being
       filled when passed a series, so just passed 1/2 the 
       min value of entire dataframe to replace 0's
    - Should I just keep the zero's?
