Two datasets covering potential for differential diagnosis (Malaria vs. fever
using serum) and diagnosing hard-to-detect diseases (Alzheimers/cognitive impairment vs. Elderly).

Malaria set: plasma, 61 samples (30 malaria, 31 non-malarial fever). 
   plasma, uplc, C18 column, QTOF-MS. 30 minute chromatography.

Alzheimers set: Nested case-control, predicting development of Alzheimers or
   other cognitive impairment within two years of blood sampling, from a population 
   of elderly without alzheimers/cognitive impairment. 
   254 patients, 72 develop alzheimers, 182 controls.
   Uncertain how class-imbalance is affecting us. 
   Plasma. uplc, C18 column, Orbitrap 13 minute chromatography.

Figures

mz_rt_scatter.pdf
   Shows that we might be able to speed up chromatography using a small window
   of retention time.
   The 50% of all features are concentrated in 
   a 300 sec. retention time window from ~750-1050sec (between red lines). Maybe we can
   classify using 1/5 the chromatography time? (300/1500seconds).  
   TODO: Try to make that plot next.  

malaria_vs_fever_roc.pdf
   Shows we can classify diseases with "the same" systemic effect (fever)
   using untargeted metabolomics.
   Uses Random forest, 1000 estimators, cross validated 50 times 
   (0.7:0.3, train:test).

malaria_true_vs_null.pdf
   Shows that model isn't BS. Just because we have 6000 features doesn't
   mean you can effectively classify a random shuffling of class-labels.
   AUCs are from 5 shuffles of the data, 50 iterations of cross-validation
   0.7:0.3

malaria_rt_slice_roc.pdf
   Using 20% of the retention time, a slice between 750 and 1050sec,
   we can classify just as well as if we used all of it. 
   (ROC curves are the same as in malaria_vs_fever_roc.pdf).
   
 
alzheimers_roc.pdf
   Same as malaria roc-curve.

alzheimers_true_vs_null.pdf
   Same as malaria true-vs-null

alzheimers_rt_slice_roc.pdf
   Using 18% of the retention time, a slice between 550 and 670, 
   have almost the same classification ability (AUC 0.82 vs 0.83)
   as using the whole dataset.
